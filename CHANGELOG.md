and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
* CICP Refactor (breaking change!)
  * Remove most references to "NCLX", as it is mostly an implementation detail, and the values are really from MPEG-CICP
  * Eliminate avifProfileFormat: having an ICC profile is not mutually exclusive with signaling CICP
  * CICP is now always available in an avifImage, set to unspecified by default
  * Added --cicp as an alias for --nclx (semi-deprecated)
  * Setting CICP via avifenc no longer overrides ICC profiles, they co-exist
  * Simplified avifenc argument parsing / warnings logic
  * avifenc/avifdec/avifdump now all display CICP when dumping AVIF information
  * nclx colr box contents are guaranteed to override AV1 bitstream CICP (as MIAF standard specifies)
  * Added comments explaining various decisions and citing standards
  * Removed ICC inspection code regarding chroma-derived mtxCoeffs; this was overdesigned. Now just honor the assoc. colorPrimaries enum
  * Reworked all examples in the README to reflect the new state of things, and clean out some cruft
* Update libaom.cmd to point at the v2.0.0 tag
* Update dav1d.cmd to point at the 0.7.1 tag
* Re-enable cpu-used=7+ in codec_aom when libaom major version > 1
* Memory allocation failures now cause libavif to abort the process (rather than undefined behavior)

## [0.3.2] - 2019-07-23
### Added

  - avifDecoderSetSource()
  - avifDecoderParse()
  - avifDecoderNextImage()
  - avifImageCopy()
  - avifDecoderReset()
- Added decoder and image timings for image sequences

### Changed
- Reorganized internal struct avifCodec to accomodate multiple codecs simultaneously (compile time; not exposed to API)
