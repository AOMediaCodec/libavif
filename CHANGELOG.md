## [0.8.1] - 2020-08-05

### Added

## [0.8.0] - 2020-07-14

### Added
* Monochrome (YUV400) support **
  * All encoding/decoding and internal memory savings are done/functional
  * libaom has a bug in chroma_check() which crashes when encoding monochrome, to be fixed in a future (>v2.0.0) version
  * rav1e didn't implement CS400 until rav1e v0.4.0
  * libavif safely falls back to YUV420 when these earlier codec versions are detected
    * NOTE: If you want to do heavy monochrome testing, wait for newer versions to libaom/rav1e!
* Image sequence encoding support
  * Required medium-sized refactors in the codec layers
  * Image sequences (tracks) now fully support all metadata properly (Exif/XMP/transforms)
  * avifenc can now encode a series of same-sized images with a consistent framerate, or each with their own custom duration
* Bilinear upsampling support
* avifenc: Add --ignore-icc, which avoids embedding the ICC profile found in the source image
* avifdec: Add --info, which attempts to decode all frames and display their basic info (merge of avifdump)
* avifenc: add --tilerowslog2 and --tilecolslog2 (wantehchang)
* Added `contrib` dir for any unofficially supported code contributions (e.g. gdk-pixbuf)

### Changed
* CICP Refactor (breaking change!)
  * Remove most references to "NCLX", as it is mostly an implementation detail, and the values are really from MPEG-CICP
  * Eliminate avifProfileFormat: having an ICC profile is not mutually exclusive with signaling CICP
  * CICP is now always available in an avifImage, set to unspecified by default
  * Added --cicp as an alias for --nclx (semi-deprecated)
  * Setting CICP via avifenc no longer overrides ICC profiles, they co-exist
  * Simplified avifenc argument parsing / warnings logic
  * avifenc/avifdec/avifdump now all display CICP when dumping AVIF information
  * nclx colr box contents are guaranteed to override AV1 bitstream CICP (as MIAF standard specifies)
  * Added comments explaining various decisions and citing standards
  * Removed ICC inspection code regarding chroma-derived mtxCoeffs; this was overdesigned. Now just honor the assoc. colorPrimaries enum
  * Reworked all examples in the README to reflect the new state of things, and clean out some cruft
  * Harvest CICP from AV1 bitstream as a fallback in avifDecoderParse() if nclx box is absent
* All data other than actual pixel data should be available and valid after a call to avifDecoderParse()
* Refactor avifDecoder internal structures to properly handle meta boxes in trak boxes (see avifMeta)
* Update libaom.cmd to point at the v2.0.0 tag
* Update dav1d.cmd to point at the 0.7.1 tag
* Re-enable cpu-used=7+ in codec_aom when libaom major version > 1
* Memory allocation failures now cause libavif to abort the process (rather than undefined behavior)
* Fix to maintain alpha range when decoding an image grid with alpha
* Improvements to avifyuv to show drift when yuv and rgb depths differ
* Remove any references to (incorrect) "av01" brand (wantehchang)
* Set up libaom to use reduced_still_picture_header (wantehchang)
* Use libaom cpu_used 6 in "good quality" usage mode (wantehchang)
* Update avifBitsReadUleb128 with latest dav1d code (wantehchang)
* Set encoder chroma sample position (wantehchang)
