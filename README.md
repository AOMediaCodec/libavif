# libavif

This library aims to be a friendly, portable C implementation of the AV1 Image
File Format, as described here:

<https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/>

It can encode and decode all AV1 supported YUV formats and bit depths (with
alpha).

It is recommended that you check out/use
[tagged releases](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/releases) instead of
just using the main branch. We will regularly create new versions as bug fixes
and features are added.

## Usage

Please see the examples in the "examples" directory. If you're already building
`libavif`, enable the CMake option `AVIF_BUILD_EXAMPLES` in order to build and
run the examples too.

## Installation

`libavif` is a package in most major OSs.

### Windows

```sh
vcpkg install libavif
```
You can also download the official windows binaries on the
[release](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/releases) page.

### macOS

Homebrew:
```sh
brew install libavif
```
MacPorts:
```sh
sudo port install libavif
```

### Linux

Debian-based distributions:
```sh
sudo apt install libavif-dev
```
Red Hat-based distributions:
```sh
sudo yum -y install libavif
```

### MinGW

For the "default" MSYS2 UCRT64 environment:
```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libavif
```

## Build Notes

Building libavif requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

No AV1 codecs are enabled by default. Enable them by setting any of the
following CMake options to `LOCAL` or `SYSTEM` whether you want to use a
locally built or a system installed version (e.g. `-DAVIF_CODEC_AOM=LOCAL`):

* `AVIF_CODEC_AOM` for [libaom](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/) (encoder
  and decoder)
* `AVIF_CODEC_DAV1D` for [dav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d)
  (decoder)
* `AVIF_CODEC_LIBGAV1` for
  [libgav1](https://chromium.googlesource.com/codecs/libgav1/) (decoder)
* `AVIF_CODEC_RAV1E` for [rav1e](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e) (encoder)
* `AVIF_CODEC_SVT` for [SVT-AV1](https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1)
  (encoder)

When set to `SYSTEM`, these libraries (in their C API form) must be externally
available (discoverable via CMake's `FIND_LIBRARY`) to use them, or if libavif
is a child CMake project, the appropriate CMake target must already exist
by the time libavif's CMake scripts are executed.

### Static Builds

When set to `LOCAL`, these libraries and the other dependencies will be pulled
locally by CMake to known-good versions.

To override a local dependency version or to use a custom build of a dependency,
first run the associated script in the `ext/` subdirectory.

### Tests

A few tests written in C can be built by enabling the `AVIF_BUILD_TESTS` CMake
option.

The remaining tests can be built by enabling the `AVIF_BUILD_TESTS` and
`AVIF_ENABLE_GTEST` CMake options. They require GoogleTest
(`-DAVIF_GTEST=SYSTEM` or `-DAVIF_GTEST=LOCAL`).

### Command Lines

The following instructions can be used to build the libavif library and the
`avifenc` and `avifdec` tools.

#### Build using installed dependencies

To link against the already installed `aom`, `libjpeg` and `libpng` dependency
libraries (recommended):

```sh
git clone -b v1.1.1 https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif.git
cmake -S libavif -B libavif/build -DAVIF_CODEC_AOM=SYSTEM -DAVIF_BUILD_APPS=ON
cmake --build libavif/build --parallel
```

#### Build everything from scratch

For development and debugging purposes, or to generate fully static binaries:

```sh
git clone -b v1.1.1 https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif.git
cmake -S libavif -B libavif/build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DAVIF_CODEC_AOM=LOCAL -DAVIF_LIBYUV=LOCAL -DAVIF_LIBSHARPYUV=LOCAL -DAVIF_JPEG=LOCAL -DAVIF_ZLIBPNG=LOCAL -DAVIF_BUILD_APPS=ON -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE="-static" -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static"
cmake --build libavif/build --parallel
```

## Prebuilt Static Binaries (Windows)

`avifenc.exe` and `avifdec.exe` can be downloaded from the
[Releases](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/releases) page.

## Development Notes

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/wiki) for extra
resources on libavif, such as the Release Checklist.

The libavif library is written in C99. Most of the tests are written in C++14.

### Formatting

Use [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the
sources from the top-level folder (`clang-format-16` preferred):

```sh
clang-format -style=file -i \
  apps/*.c apps/*/*.c apps/*/*.cc apps/*/*.h examples/*.c \
  include/avif/*.h src/*.c src/*.cc \
  tests/*.c tests/*/*.cc tests/*/*.h
```

Use [cmake-format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format) to format the
CMakeLists.txt files from the top-level folder:

```sh
cmake-format -i \
  CMakeLists.txt \
  tests/CMakeLists.txt \
  cmake/Modules/*.cmake \
  contrib/CMakeLists.txt \
  contrib/gdk-pixbuf/CMakeLists.txt \
  android_jni/avifandroidjni/src/main/jni/CMakeLists.txt
```
